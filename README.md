# SystemTest: Structural Synthesis and Discovery

## Overview

This repository contains an autonomous algorithm discovery system implementing Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI). The system uses a hybrid Neuro-Genetic architecture to synthesize programs, discover reusable concepts, and expand its own grammar dynamically.

## Core Components

* **Systemtest.py**: Main orchestrator handling the life-cycle loop, problem generation, and H-Module (Discovery) / L-Module (Execution) coordination.
* **neuro_genetic_synthesizer.py**: Implements a pure-Python Neural Network (`SimpleNN`) with manual Backpropagation (Stochastic Gradient Descent). It guides the genetic search without external dependencies like PyTorch.

## Capabilities

1. **Genuine Learning**: Uses mathematical gradient descent to update neural weights based on successful program evaluations.
2. **No Heuristics**: All hardcoded strategies and template-based searchers have been removed. Solutions are found solely through stochastic search and neural guidance.
3. **Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI)**: Functions discovered by the system are archived and dynamically loaded into the synthesis grammar, allowing the system to reuse its own inventions for future tasks.
4. **Curriculum Learning**: Autonomous task generation that respects a strict difficulty curve, ensuring the system masters basic concepts (Level 1) before attempting complex logic (Level 3+).
5. **Island Model Evolution**: Maintains multiple isolated populations (islands) with periodic migration, preserving genetic diversity and preventing premature convergence.
6. **Novelty Search**: Incentivizes the discovery of rare code patterns (N-gram rarity) to escape local optima.

## Usage

Run the infinite life-cycle loop:

```bash
python Systemtest.py hrm-life
```

This will start the autonomous loop:

1. L-Module: Wakes up and attempts to solve generated tasks using the current neural model.
2. H-Module: Dreams on accumulated experiences to discover new subroutines.
3. Feedback: Updates neural weights and expands the primitive set with new concepts.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Standard library only (No `numpy`, `torch`, or other heavy dependencies required).
